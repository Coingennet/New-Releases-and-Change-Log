### **Is it Safe?**

\
This is a very legitimate and appropriate question that everybody should be asking before sending any capital to any place. In Deficopy , we understand the importance of security, and we are gonna describe the layer of protection that we have implemented to make funds and experience as secure as possible.

The most crucial aspect here is that we aren't custodians of your capital. When you are depositing funds   , the deposit goes directly to Binance, and it is under Binance security

### **How secure is Binance?**

Binance meets the internationally recognized ISO/IEC 27001 standard. You can read more about this [ in this article.](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-binance-awarded-iso-security-accreditation)

They keep an insurance fund for emergencies, known as [SAFU](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/secure-asset-fund-for-users). 10% of all trading fees are destined to the fund, and it's stored in a cold wallet.

Besides this, Binance has implemented pattern recognition to detect unusual activity, which is nurtured with an almost 20-month history of transactions, involving trillions of dollars in trades, which allows them to detect irregular trades and any suspicious activity.

### **But still, how secure is Deficopy ?** 

API keys are RSA-encrypted before being stored in the database, and the database is in an isolated DMZ without public access.

We use a certificate for encrypting/decrypting the API-Keys, which is kept outside the database servers.

**Deficopy** API-keys aren't shared with anybody, not even with the user/owner of the account. This may change in the future, but still, they are always created without withdrawn permissions.

Rate limits and ReCaptcha are in place to thwart brute-force and automated scripting attacks.\

### **What can you do to add extra security?**

The security of your account is teamwork, and you have to do the part too:

Enable 2-factor authentication, which will be required for accessing your account and each time to try to withdraw.

Be aware of scammers. They will try different ways to try to scam you. They will impersonate **Deficopy** agents, founders, investors. They are ingenious, so keep in mind that we'll never ask you to make a deposit, for giving you access to certain features, or for compensation for any problem that the platform may have suffered. We don't need your password or your 2FA code to give you support.

**What happens if the  disappear?**

{% hint style="info" %}
You still may have valid concerns about what could happen with your funds if **Deficopy** disappears. On the website, you will find the team, and there you will see the founders, supporters  with links to their social network profiles. Deficopy  currently has more than $45,000,000 of capital under management. Deficopy  is backed by two different VC groups. We  have been operating for almost 3 years now and our domain name is registered till 2025 and we will renew it for another 5 years. So, there will always be someone left to take care of the project or return the funds if needed.
