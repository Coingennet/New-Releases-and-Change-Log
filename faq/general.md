### **Can I try Defi Copy without a subscription?**

â€ŒSome features of Defi Copy  are free to use. You can use our trading interface to post and manage trades on crypto exchanges. You can also browse our website, and forums, and see traders' performances.

### What is the difference between following and copying?

Copying is an automated process, where your exchange account will mirror a traders' account: it will open and close the same positions, on the same pairs. Thus, your profit and loss will be the same as that of the traders. All trades are executed automatically.&#x20;

Following is done manually. By navigating to a trader's profile, you can see all the things (buys, sells, openings and closing for trades) that the trader is doing. You can choose to follow his trades manually by opening a position on defi copy  or by going to your favorite exchange and posting a trade there.
