# Copying

### What does 'copying' mean?

‌By copying a trader, your account will automatically execute the trader's trading activity. In order to copy a trader, you have to connect your exchange account (currently Binance is supported) to your Deficopy  account.&#x20;

‌All the trades coming from the trader will be executed automatically on your end. You will be asked to specify the percentage of your portfolio you want to allocate for copying. The amounts for the copied trades will be calculated proportionately
