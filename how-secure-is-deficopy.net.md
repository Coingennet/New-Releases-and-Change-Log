# How secure is  coingen.net

**Safe and secure**

We do not hold your funds, they are secured on the exchange side. Our current Defi copy   is part of the Binance Broker program and the funds are covered by their security layer and protected by their SAFU fund.

**Security level**

API keys are RSA-encrypted before being stored in the database, and the database is in an isolated DMZ without public access. We use a certificate for encrypting/decrypting the API-Keys, which is kept outside the database servers.

**Extra security layers**

The security of your account is a teamwork, and you have to do the part too by enabling the 2-factor authentication (2FA), which will be required for accessing your account and each time to try to withdraw.
