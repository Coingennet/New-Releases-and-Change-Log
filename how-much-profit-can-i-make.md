# How much profit can I make?

{% hint style="success" %}
As a platform, our role is as an intermediate tool to make it easy to trade, but we canâ€™t assure any profit. It depends on your settings and market conditions, portfolio choice, master trader you choose to follow.

&#x20; Crypto markets are very volatile, for this reason, unless you are an expert trader, we encourage you to only manage the funds you are willing to lose.
