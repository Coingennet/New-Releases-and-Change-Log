# How does  coingen.net  receive revenue?

**where does it earn income? Is it sustainable?**

Deficopy  obtains revenues from three  sources:

### _1-The first is a commission of 15% of all the benefits obtained by users who use Profit Sharing like grab, uber business model._&#x20;

For example, if a provider charges a commission of 45% on the benefits obtained with the Profit Sharing strategy, Deficopy  keeps 15%, and the other 30% corresponds to the trader.

### 2. we get 60% of the profit of trading fees when you trade on binance too. so we have this fee paid by binance to offset the cost of our domain name hosting system.
