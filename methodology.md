# CoinGen Methodology

### 1. Supply Metrics &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The actual liquidity supply in the market and the ratio between these datas: Max Supply, Total supply, Circulating supply and the staking tokens. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Max Supply:
* Total Supply:
* Circ. Supply:
* Staking tokens:

When token are kept in cold wallets or staking in network that are off exchanges, this makes it illiquid. It is still a part of the circulating supply but not part of the liquid supply. These tokens are not available for selling or trading. It is a way of removing liquidity from the market, so it can create a supply crunch when the demand is high.

### 2. Market Cap Metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the ratio between these datas: Volume, Market Cap (MC) and Fully Diluted Value (FDV)
{% endhint %}

* FDV:
* MC:&#x20;
* Volume:

Through our chart, you can see two crucial metrics:

1. **The MC/FDV ratio:** <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> **allows investors to assess whether a token price is overheated**. That's because a low ratio indicates that the supply will eventually be higher than the actual demand once project owners release more tokens. With the demand increasing rapidly, the price will likely drop as the market adjusts.&#x20;

Additional, another meaning that we need to consider as well is when the lower ratio indicates there’ll be **a lot of inflationary pressure as new coins are released.**

&#x20; 2\. **Volume/ MC:** Low trading volume can indicate a lack of interest in either buying or selling and vice versa.&#x20;

Hence, it will help investors possibly to determine if  token is overvalued and has many investors terested in a certain time p or not. The more the ratio of trading volume to market cap, the better it is.

### 3. Current Inflation &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This metric aims to analyze the actual inflation rate through the data: Token Release, Block Rewards, Burn, Debate
{% endhint %}

* Token Release:
* Block Rewards:
* Burn:
* Debates:

If some cryptocurrencies has max supply, it's inherently inflationary, meaning the number of coins in circulation rises over time. Bitcoin is a good example for comprehensive understanding this. Bitcoin has max supply is 21 million and it still has current inflation rate is 1.75% (at the writing time). It means the number of BTC in circulation rises over time.

New cryptocurrencies can be mined into existence – that’s how Bitcoin works – or issued to Proof-of-S validators.

Issuing new cryptocurrencies to network actors encourages participation. Some inflationary currencies have fixed supplies, while others have unlimited supplies – there is no limit to the number of tokens that could be in circulation.

### 4. Monthly Token Release

{% hint style="info" %}
This metric include the actual amount of tokens put into the market: tokens unlocked for investors, team, activity, ecosytem... and block rewards as well. The price is the hgighest price in the month.
{% endhint %}

_**Monthly Token Release** = Circulating supply current month -  Circulating supply previous month_

### 5. Token.Dom vs Sector.Dom&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_A measure of token's value (ratio of token's market cap) in the context of the larger cryptocurrency market that is another tokens in the same sector._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

For example: _ **Near.Dom** = \[Near market cap/ Sector market cap (Smart contract platform)]\*100_

\
It is simply **the ratio between the market cap of a particular cryptocurrency and the total market cap of the entire sector in crypto space**. Near's dominance, a measure of how strong a cryptocurrency is compared with all other coins in the market.
