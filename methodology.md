  crypto is crucial. Below you will find the finer details with respect to the
  important metrics of CoinGen.

# CoinGen Methodology

### 1. Supply Metrics &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The actual liquidity supply in the market and the ratio between these datas: Max Supply, Total supply, Circulating supply and the staking tokens. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Max Supply:
* Total Supply:
* Circ. Supply:
* Staking tokens:

When token are kept in cold wallets or staking in network that are off exchanges, this makes it illiquid. It is still a part of the circulating supply but not part of the liquid supply. These tokens are not available for selling or trading. It is a way of removing liquidity from the market, so it can create a supply crunch when the demand is high.

### 2. Market Cap Metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the ratio between these datas: Volume, Market Cap (MC) and Fully Diluted Value (FDV)
{% endhint %}

* FDV:
* MC:&#x20;
* Volume:

Through our chart, you can see two crucial metrics:

1. **The MC/FDV ratio:** <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> **allows investors to assess whether a token price is overheated**. That's because a low ratio indicates that the supply will eventually be higher than the actual demand once project owners release more tokens. With the demand increasing rapidly, the price will likely drop as the market adjusts.&#x20;

Additional, another meaning that we need to consider as well is when the lower ratio indicates there’ll be **a lot of inflationary pressure as new coins are released.**

&#x20; 2\. **Volume/ MC:** Low trading volume can indicate a lack of interest in either buying or selling and vice versa.&#x20;

Hence, it will help investors possibly to determine if  token is overvalued and has many investors terested in a certain time p or not. The more the ratio of trading volume to market cap, the better it is.

### 3. Actual Inflation &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This metric aims to analyze the actual inflation rate through the data: Token Release, Block Rewards, Burn, Debate
{% endhint %}

This metric include the actual amount of tokens put into the market: tokens unlocked for investors, team, activity, ecosytem... and block rewards as well.&#x20;

_**Actual Inflation** = \[(Circ. supply current day -  Circ. supply previous year in the same day )/Circ. supply previous year in the same day]\*100_

* Token Release: token unlocked for investors who participated in fundraising rounds of project&#x20;
* Block Rewards: according to the token minted in network of project
* Burned: Burning tokens involves **indefinitely removing a digital asset from circulation and reducing its supply. Amount of token burning data depends on algorithsm of project's network or according to program.**
* Debates:

Some inflationary currencies have fixed supplies (Max suppluy), while others have unlimited supplies (No max supply) – there is no limit to the number of tokens that could be in circulation.

ome cryptocurrencies **has max supply**, it's  inflationary, meaning the number of coins in circulation rises over time. Bitcoin is a good example for comprehensive understanding this. Bitcoin has max supply is 21 million and it still has current inflation rate is 1.75% (at the writing time). It means the number of BTC in circulation rises over time.

For a handful of cryptocurrencies that **has no max supply**. Issuing new cryptocurrencies to network actors encourages participation. It's inherently inflationary in this way.

Additionally, these coins will be augmented in inflation rate by releasing coin for investors in fundraising rounds over time and then selling or trading in exchanges.

So we calculate it by changes of circulating supply present compared previous month. Then, we can see how these amount of token release will affect the price of token. It's reason why we generate this chart for investor can see the insight of tokenomics.

### 4. Monthly Token Release

{% hint style="info" %}
This metric include the actual amount of tokens put into the market: tokens unlocked for investors, team, activity, ecosytem... and block rewards as well. The price is the highest price in the month.
{% endhint %}

_**Monthly Token Release** = Circulating supply current month -  Circulating supply previous month_

This metrics will help investors easily know the impact of selling pressure from token release to price over time.&#x20;

### 5. Token.Dom vs Sector.Dom&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_A measure of token's valu (ratio of token's market cap) in the context of the larger cryptocurrency market that is another tokens in the same sector._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

For example: _ **Near.Dom** = \[Near market cap/ Sector market cap (Smart contract platform)]\*100_

\
It is simply **the ratio between the market cap of a particular cryptocurrency and the total market cap of the entire sector in crypto space**. Near's dominance, a measure of how strong a cryptocurrency is compared with all other coins in the market.
