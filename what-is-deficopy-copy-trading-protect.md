# What is coingen.net Copy Trading  Protect?

**Introduction:**

The idea behind investing in a strategy or a bot is two-fold

* It should make money
* If the markets go down, it should protect you from losses

This is the promise of DefiCopy. Every investment option published on DefiCopy Copy Trading  goes through rigorous testing by the creator and a multi-part review process by the DefiCopy Copy Trading Team before being published so that we can make sure that this promise is upheld. Not only this, but all strategies are also constantly monitored for improvements by both the creator and the DefiCopy Copy Trading team.

Despite going through multiple checks, there is no guarantee of returns for any of the investment bundles. This is because no one can predict the market and there is an inherent risk in investing in volatile assets.

Creators cannot predict every kind of market condition and hence cannot prevent all losses but what they can do is not charge their own fee for the months when you have losses. DefiCopy Copy Trading ensures that the creators only collect their fees if the investors make profits in a period specified by the creator. If not then DefiCopy Copy Trading will refund the investor their subscription fees. This feature is called DefiCopy Copy Trading Protect.\


**How it works for Copy**&#x20;

* We want to make sure that you pay fees only when the promise of the strategy is fulfilled. This means that we should charge only if the strategy makes profits for you or stops you from making losses in a crashing market.&#x20;
* Deficopy  protect is only eligible on those bundles where the Master  has opted in



**How it works for Master Trader.**

* Deficopy  Protect is an opt-in feature from the master trader
* &#x20;will collect and hold any fees paid by the copy  trader  to the master trader  till the end of the month.
* If the strategy makes losses then any subscription fees collected from the copy trader  in the month are refunded back to the user.
* The master trader   can enable or disable this option as they like. Whether the option is applicable to an copy trade  or not will depend on when they invested.

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**&#x20;

**Will Deficopy Protect be available for every bundle on  Deficopy copy t for investors?**

**Ans.** No. This is an optional feature that the master trader  will decide while publishing a bundle.

**How will Deficopy  measure that there was a loss?**

**Ans.**  As soon as a bundle is published, there is a common master run that is started which keeps running which is the primary source of buy and sell signals. We will use that as our reference to measure profit and loss. This is done to avoid any issues that might happen because of investor actions or unforeseen external issues and keep the decision-making process consistent.

**Does the 'Loss' include fees paid by the investors?**

**Ans.** Yes. The loss will be looked at a net of fees paid to the master trader&#x20;

**How will Deficopy  manage the fee payout to master trader  who want to allow Deficopy  Protect?** \


**Ans. Deficopy** will hold the funds for the month and make a payout to the master trader  at the end of the month only if Deficopy  Protect is not eligible.

**Will the copy trader  get subscription fees back if they exit before the month is over?**

**Ans.**  Yes. If an investor exits before the month is over,  then they will be eligible for a fee refund.

**Will the investors’ trading losses be covered?**&#x20;

**Ans.**  No. Trading is not risk-free. No one can guarantee that there will be no losses. The historical and live performance that investors use to judge an investment option is only an indication of how future performance can be.

When investors face a loss we believe that we did not add any value to their lives and are morally obliged to return the subscription fee we charged them. That is the best that we can do and that is what we adhere to.

**How can an investor apply for a refund under Deficopy  Protect?**

**Ans.** The payout for Deficopy  Protect refund gets issued automatically at the end of every month. In case you are eligible, you will get the payout in your account balance. \
**What is zero return in a month counted as?**

**Ans.**  Zero returns are also eligible for a refund.

**What happens if there is a loss on an investor’s personal run due to manual interventions by the investor, exchange failures, system failures, etc?**

**Ans.**  To decide if a refund needs to be given or not, we only refer to the master trader  run on the bundle. This run is immune to any issues arising out of manual interventions from the investor side or any system failures. It will always have orders placed. This helps us remove any ambiguity and makes the decision-making process transparent.

&#x20;**What happens to referral credits for a user who is given a refund under Deficopy  Protect?**

&#x20;**Ans.** Since no revenue is made by Deficopy  in these cases there is no referral incentive.
